# Google Gemini API Rate Limit Solution

## Problem
Your beta route is hitting Google Gemini API rate limits with error 429 "Too Many Requests". The error indicates quota exhaustion on the free tier.

## Root Cause
Google Gemini API has strict rate limits on the free tier:
- **Free Tier Limits**: Limited requests per minute/day per model
- **Token Limits**: Limited input tokens for image processing
- **Model Specific**: `gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview` has specific quotas

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Exponential Backoff Retry Mechanism**
Added intelligent retry logic that:
- Detects 429 rate limit errors
- Extracts retry delay from Google's error response
- Uses exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 8s delays)
- Respects Google's suggested retry delays
- Maximum 3 retry attempts

```typescript
async function retryWithBackoff<T>(
  fn: () => Promise<T>,
  maxRetries: number = 3,
  baseDelay: number = 1000
): Promise<T>
```

### 2. **Enhanced Error Handling**
Comprehensive error classification:
- **RATE_LIMIT**: 429 errors with retry suggestions
- **QUOTA_EXCEEDED**: Free tier quota exhaustion
- **AUTH_ERROR**: Invalid API key issues
- **SUBSCRIPTION_LIMIT**: Your app's credit system

### 3. **User-Friendly Error Messages**
Frontend now shows specific error types:
- Rate limit notifications with helpful details
- Upgrade suggestions for quota issues
- Clear API configuration error messages

## Immediate Solutions

### Option 1: Upgrade Google AI Studio Plan
**Recommended for Production**
1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)
2. Go to billing settings
3. Upgrade to a paid plan for higher quotas
4. Cost: ~$0.002 per 1K input tokens for images

### Option 2: Request Quota Increase
1. Visit [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Navigate to APIs & Services > Quotas
3. Search for "Generative Language API"
4. Request quota increase for your use case

### Option 3: Implement Request Queuing (Temporary)
For development/testing, space out requests:
- Add delays between requests
- Implement a queue system
- Batch process requests

## Code Changes Made

### API Route (`/api/try-on-beta`)
✅ **Correct API Usage**: Now using `generateContent` method with Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Preview  
✅ **Nano Banana Model**: Using `gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview` for image generation  
✅ **Multiple Input Images**: Proper text prompt + two images (person + garment) as inlineData  
✅ **Exponential Backoff**: Added retry mechanism for rate limit handling  
✅ **Enhanced Error Handling**: Comprehensive error classification and messaging  
✅ **Retry Logic**: Extracts retry delays from Google's response  

### Frontend (`/dashboard-beta`)
✅ Added specific error handling for rate limits  
✅ User-friendly toast notifications  
✅ Detailed error messages with upgrade suggestions  
✅ Extended error interface with details field  

## Testing the Solution

### 1. Test Rate Limit Handling
```bash
# Make multiple rapid requests to trigger rate limiting
# The system should now retry automatically
```

### 2. Monitor Console Logs
Look for:
```
Rate limited. Retrying in 7000ms (attempt 1/4)
Rate limited. Retrying in 14000ms (attempt 2/4)
```

### 3. Check Error Messages
Users should see helpful messages like:
> "Google Gemini API rate limit exceeded. Please try again in a few minutes."

## Production Recommendations

### 1. **Upgrade to Paid Plan**
- Essential for production use
- Predictable costs and quotas
- Better performance and reliability

### 2. **Implement Caching**
- Cache generated images to reduce API calls
- Store successful results in your database
- Implement image similarity checks

### 3. **Request Throttling**
- Limit user requests per minute
- Implement user-based rate limiting
- Queue requests during high load

### 4. **Monitoring & Alerting**
- Track API usage and costs
- Monitor error rates and types
- Set up alerts for quota approaching

## Cost Estimation

### Google Gemini API Pricing (as of 2024)
- **Input**: ~$0.002 per 1K tokens (images ~258 tokens each)
- **Output**: ~$0.008 per 1K tokens (generated images)
- **Estimated cost per try-on**: ~$0.01-0.05

### Monthly Estimates
- 100 try-ons/day = ~$30-150/month
- 1000 try-ons/day = ~$300-1500/month

## Alternative Solutions

### 1. **Model Fallback**
Implement fallback to your existing Fashn AI when Gemini is rate limited:
```typescript
try {
  // Try Gemini first
  return await callGeminiAPI();
} catch (rateLimitError) {
  // Fall back to Fashn AI
  return await callFashnAPI();
}
```

### 2. **Hybrid Approach**
- Use Gemini for premium users
- Use Fashn AI for free tier users
- Load balance between providers

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Test the implemented retry mechanism
2. **Short-term**: Consider upgrading Google AI Studio plan
3. **Long-term**: Implement comprehensive rate limiting and caching
4. **Monitor**: Track usage patterns and costs

The implemented solution should handle most rate limiting scenarios gracefully while providing clear feedback to users about quota limitations.
